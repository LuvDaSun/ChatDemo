# Chat Demo web client

This is the front-end for the project. It is a web application built with lit and goodrouter and a variety of api clients. If you use visual studio changes to the front-end should rebuild automagically. If you add or change a route however, you need to rebuild and restart the server!

Then, after rebuliding either manually or automatic, reload the page to see your changes.
